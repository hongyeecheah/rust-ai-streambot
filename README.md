# Rust AI Stream Analyzer Twitch Bot

Rust-ai-streambot is a transformative AI pipeline completely built in Rust. Focused on Transformer/Tensor code and taking advantage of the Candle framework by Huggingface, this systems programming language approach provides a robust interface to AI model interaction and stream analysis. It enables local execution on MacOS devices equipped with M1/M2/M3 ARM GPUs, bypassing the need for external dependencies and Python code and facilitating the integration of local large language models (LLMs) with Rust.

## Key Features

-   **Local LLM**: Leverages Rust-based LLMs, Mistral and Gemma, from the Candle framework for direct and efficient AI operations prioritizing local execution to harness the full power of MacOS Metal GPUs.
-   **Comprehensive AI Analyzer**: Incorporates a high-level AI analyzer capable of processing and generating across various domains, facilitating a continuous flow of AI-generated content (In Progress).
-   **Voice and Speech Integration**: Plans to integrate with Whisper for voice-driven interactions, allowing use
